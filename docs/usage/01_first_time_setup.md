# Setting up for the first time

There is no hassle in setting up `wappdriver`.

!!! note
    Make sure you have matching versions of Chrome and Chrome Driver.

After you `pip install wappdriver`, you can directly run your code.

- You will be prompted to enter the installation path of Chrome Driver Executable (only once). Just copy and paste the correct path there.
  
- When you load WhatsApp for the first time, you have to scan the QR Code that will be displayed on your computer from your phone, to login into WhatsApp Web.

!!! warning
      - WhatsApp does not allow you to log in to the same account from multiple chrome tabs.
        So **make sure to close any chrome tab having WhatsApp Web open**. Not doing so will lead to errors.
      - Your phone which is having that WhatsApp account must stay connected to the internet for WhatsApp Web to work
      - Do not spam others. Use `wappdriver` for educational purposes only
