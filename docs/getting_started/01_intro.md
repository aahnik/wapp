### Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è

- WhatsApp does not allow you to log in to the same account from multiple chrome tabs.
  So **make sure to close any chrome tab having WhatsApp Web open**. Not doing so will lead to errors.
- Your phone which is having that WhatsApp account must stay connected to the internet for WhatsApp Web to work

### Requirements

[![made-with-python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Made%20with-Python-1f425f.svg)](https://www.python.org/)

- **[Chrome Browser](https://www.google.com/chrome/)**
- [Chrome Driver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/)

Make sure to have matching versions of the Chrome Browser and Chrome Driver.
I recommend using the latest stable release for both to get the best performance.

WappDriver does not support other Browsers. Please use Chrome for a smooth experience
