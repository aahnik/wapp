In this case we call our bot exhausted or tired. You can solve this by overriding the default timeout value.This can be done by passing an optional argument to the WhatsApp context manager. from wappdriver import WhatsApp with WhatsApp(timeout=100) as bot: bot.send('aahnik', 'Exhausted ?') Note The default value of timeout is 50s. If bot is exhausted, increase timeout. Update Variables When you run wappdriver for the first time, the values of selectors is fetched from the internet. If you want to update them from wappdriver import update_vars update_vars() If any new updates are availaible, they will be downloaded. Set Chrome Driver Path When you will use wappdriver for the first time, it will ask you to input the path of Chrome Driver Executable in your system. You can set the path programmatically from wappdriver import set_chrome_driver_path path = '/home/aahnik/Downloads/chrome_driver' set_chrome_driver_path(path) Replace the value of variable path with the path of chrome driver in your system. In Brief Pass name of recipient as first argument and after that you can pass as many message arguments as you wish. Note The name of recipient must be saved in your contacts. Each message argument must be a string. If you want to send a file, pass the absolute path of the file to the function. Example Use with WhatsApp() as bot: bot.send('aahnik', # name of recipient 'hi send by a bot', # message # absolute path of an image on computer '/home/aahnik/image.png', # absolute path of a video on computer '/home/aahnik/video.mp4', # absolute path of pdf on computer '/home/aahnik/django.pdf' ) The first argument you need to pass is the recipient's name which must be saved in your phone.
